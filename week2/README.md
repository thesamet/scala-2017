Week 2 Assignment
=================

Welcome to the second week assignment of our Scala class.

To get started, clone this repository and import it into IntelliJ.

    git clone https://github.com/thesamet/scala-2017.git
     
    cd scala-2017/week2

In IntelliJ, follow [these instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-sbt.html#import_project)

Our exercises this week will focus on basic syntax and recursion.

- Open Maybes.scala and follow the instructions there.
  For this file, we have unit tests in MaybesSpec.scala.

- To run the tests, type `test` in SBT.

- Or... you can run the tests in IntelliJ and it will show you which one passed/failed.


Enjoy and don't hesitate to send me questions!
