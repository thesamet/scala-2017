Week 3 Assignment
=================

Welcome to the third week assignment of our Scala class.

To get started, clone this repository and import it into IntelliJ.

    git clone https://github.com/thesamet/scala-2017.git
     
    cd scala-2017/week3

In IntelliJ, follow [these instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-sbt.html#import_project)

Our exercises this week will focus on concurrent programming.

- Open Futures.scala and fill in the blanks there.
- Run tests using SBT or IntelliJ.

In the second exercise you will implement a (simple) version of the video
service and the trends aggregator using an actor system.

- Open VideoService.scala
- This program is just an executable. You can run it from inside sbt:

  Start sbt:

  ```
  $ sbt
  sbt> runMain VideoServiceMain
  ```

  When all the tests will pass, a message in green will be displayed.


Enjoy and don't hesitate to send me questions!
