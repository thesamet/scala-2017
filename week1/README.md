Week 1 Assignment
=================

Welcome to the first assignment of our Scala class.

To get started, clone this repository and import it into IntelliJ.

    git clone https://github.com/thesamet/scala-2017.git
     
    cd scala-2017/week1

In IntelliJ, follow [these instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-sbt.html#import_project)

Our exercises this week will focus on basic syntax and recursion.

Part 1:
-------

- Open Trees.scala and read the instructions through the file.

- Trees.scala is a runnable program (it has a main() functin). You can try running
  it by choosing "Run..." from the Run menu.

- If you prefer to edit in IntelliJ and running in the terminal (I do!), then
  execute SBT inside the week1 directory, and inside SBT type `runMain Trees`

  You can also type `~runMain Trees` which would automatically run your code
  each time you save it.

Part 2:
-------

- Open ListUtils.scala and follow the instructions there.
  For this file, we have unit tests in ListUtilsTest.scala.

- To run the tests, type `test` in SBT.

- Or... you can run the tests in IntelliJ and it will show you which one passed/failed.


Enjoy and don't hesitate to send me questions!
